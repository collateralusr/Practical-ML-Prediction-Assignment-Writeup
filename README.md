# Prediction-Assignment-Writeup

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the Coursera Practical Machine Learning Course. The objective is to predict the manner in which participants performed a specific exercise. The project utilizes data collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants, who were instructed to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

## Background

In the era of wearable devices like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, gathering extensive data about personal activity has become cost-effective. This project aligns with the quantified self movement, where individuals regularly measure themselves to enhance health, identify behavior patterns, or simply out of tech enthusiasm. While people often quantify the amount of a particular activity, assessing the quality of that activity is less common. The focus here is on using accelerometer data to predict the correctness of barbell lifts.

## Data

- Training Data: [pml-training.csv](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv)
- Test Data: [pml-testing.csv](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

These datasets consist of accelerometer data recorded during barbell lifts, and they are publicly accessible thanks to the generosity of the data source: [Har Human Activity Recognition Group](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).
